This is the file for the rotating sensor, named turret for an obvious reason
My goal is too also use the four direction sensor to save time
The steps are listed below as such:

1st. Detect which direction has wall
2nd. If has wall the turret will turn to its direction
3rd. If detect colour (treasure), indicate, and deploy pin
