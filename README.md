# Current Problems:
Need a way for the robot to determine its orientation and act accordingly.

Haven't tested if the function can be call and still work normally

If the function cannot be called, may have to input all the movement into this navigate() function

Locomotion cannot be tested until prototype forms

# Tasks :
Turret.py still progress 0%

Reminder to code for the pin deployment too

Find a way to implement orientation of robots into navigation.py
